# getting-started-with-threejs

Overview
This project demonstrates a basic setup for an interactive 3D scene using Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.

Key Features
Renderer: Utilizes WebGLRenderer with antialiasing for smooth rendering.
Camera: PerspectiveCamera set up with adjustable field of view, aspect ratio, and near/far clipping planes.
Controls: Includes OrbitControls for interactive camera movement with damping enabled.
Scene: Initializes a Three.js scene with an Icosahedron mesh and wireframe overlay.
Lighting: Uses HemisphereLight to illuminate the scene.
Usage
