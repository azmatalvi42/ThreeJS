Renderer: Utilizes WebGLRenderer with antialiasing for smooth rendering.
Camera: PerspectiveCamera set up with adjustable field of view, aspect ratio, and near/far clipping planes.
Controls: Includes OrbitControls for interactive camera movement with damping enabled.
Scene: Initializes a Three.js scene with an Icosahedron mesh and wireframe overlay.
Lighting: Uses HemisphereLight to illuminate the scene.
Usage
Clone or download the repository to explore and modify the 3D scene. Open index.html in a web browser to view the interactive demo.

Technologies
Three.js: JavaScript 3D library.
OrbitControls: Provided by Three.js for camera manipulation.
